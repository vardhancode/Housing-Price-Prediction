# Housing-Price-Prediction
In this project, we built a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the area of a property using the "House Price Prediction" dataset from Kaggle. We began by importing and preprocessing the data, where we focused only on the relevant columns Area and Price and ensured the dataset was clean and ready for modeling. 

We then trained a LinearRegression model from scikit-learn and evaluated it using MAE, MSE, and R² score to measure accuracy. For visualization, we plotted actual vs. predicted prices, correcting the regression line by sorting values before plotting. This gave us a working model that can predict house prices from area — a complete ML pipeline from preprocessing to prediction and evaluation.
