# Housing-Price-Prediction
In this project, we built a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the area of a property using the "House Price Prediction" dataset by Harish from Kaggle. We began by importing and preprocessing the data, where we focused only on the relevant columns Area and Price and ensured the dataset was clean and ready for modeling.
